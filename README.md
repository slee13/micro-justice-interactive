# Micro Justice Interactive
## An interactive website to visualize people's experiences of microaggressions
### How it works

This will be displayed on desktop views
The mobile view holds the voting interaction.  (Currently lives as a framer prototype here: https://framer.cloud/QlXwl _credit to Kelvyn for initial prototype_)
It should:
1. Display all recorded votes on all instances of microaggressions
2. Display a new recorded vote on an instance of microaggressions
3. Animate and bundle votes for an instance of a microaggression when it is selected
4. Show related list of micro justices for that microaggressions
