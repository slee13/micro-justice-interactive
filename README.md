# Micro Justice Interactive
## An interactive website to visualize people's experiences of microaggressions
### How it works

This will be displayed on desktop views
The mobile view holds the voting interaction.  (Currently lives as a framer prototype here: https://framer.cloud/MlOjc _credit to Kelvyn for initial prototype_)

The desktop view should:
1. Display all recorded votes on all instances of microaggressions (MA) _currently shows all recorded votes on one instance of a microaggression_
2. Display a new recorded vote on an instance of MA _currently shows a gray circle if it's a new vote regarless of which shape it should be_
3. Display votes for an instance of a MA when it is selected
4. Show related list of micro justices for that MA if selected

Nice to have:
1. Animate tokens to bundle together when a MA is selected
2. Show instructions on how to use with phone
